# simple-number-guessing-game
This is a simple mobile app built with TypeScript and React Native.

### Objective
To showcase basic React Native features and functionality.  This includes, switching screens, using state, and using 
props.  The styling is also conditionally rendered from device type, orientation, and resolution.

*The assets and color palette are themed around the popular character Spamton from the game Deltarune.*

### Install dependencies

yarn
```

### Run the app

```bash
npx expo start
```
